# Single Device Login Update

## Overview
Updated the ChatGPT Cookie Importer extension to implement single device login functionality. This ensures that only one active session per user account is allowed at any time.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Authentication Flow
- **Device Identification**: Each extension instance now generates a unique device ID
- **Enhanced Login Request**: Login requests now include device information (ID, type, platform details)
- **Server Communication**: Added device ID to all authentication-related server communications

### 2. Session Management
- **Periodic Session Validation**: Extension validates session every 30 seconds with the server
- **Forced Logout Detection**: Automatically detects when logged out from another device
- **Enhanced Session Data**: Session storage now includes device information and timestamps

### 3. Cookie Management
- **Automatic Cookie Clearing**: When forced logout occurs, all extension-related cookies are automatically cleared
- **Comprehensive Domain Coverage**: Clears cookies from all relevant domains (chatgpt.com, openai.com, etc.)
- **Service Worker Integration**: Added cookie clearing functionality to the service worker

### 4. User Interface Improvements
- **Single Device Notice**: Login form now displays information about single device policy
- **Device Status Display**: Shows current device status after login
- **Enhanced Error Messages**: Better user feedback for device-related authentication events

### 5. Security Enhancements
- **Server Logout Notification**: Properly notifies server when user manually logs out
- **Session Cleanup**: Comprehensive cleanup of all session data on logout/forced logout
- **Device Tracking**: Server can track and manage active devices per user

## Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified
1. **popup.js** - Main extension logic with device management
2. **service_worker.js** - Cookie clearing functionality
3. **popup.html** - UI updates for device status display

### New Functions Added
- `generateDeviceId()` - Creates unique device identifiers
- `clearExtensionCookies()` - Removes all extension-related cookies
- `handleForcedLogout()` - Manages logout from other devices
- `startSessionValidation()` / `stopSessionValidation()` - Session monitoring
- `clearAllExtensionCookies()` - Service worker cookie clearing

### Security Features
- Device ID stored securely in Chrome extension storage
- All authentication requests include device verification
- Automatic session invalidation on device conflicts
- Complete cookie cleanup on security events

## User Experience
1. **Login**: Users see notification about single device policy
2. **Active Session**: Device status is displayed in the extension popup
3. **Multiple Devices**: Attempting to login on a new device automatically logs out the previous session
4. **Logout**: Manual logout clears all data and notifies the server
5. **Forced Logout**: Clear messaging when logged out from another device

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Security**: Prevents unauthorized concurrent sessions
- **Better Control**: Users have clear understanding of their active sessions
- **Clean State**: Automatic cleanup prevents cookie conflicts
- **User Awareness**: Clear feedback about device-related authentication events

## Testing
The extension now requires corresponding server-side changes to support:
- Device-aware authentication endpoints
- Session validation with device checking
- Proper handling of device conflicts
- Enhanced logout functionality

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding device management UI for users to see/manage their devices
- Implement device trust/remember functionality
- Add optional push notifications for security events
- Consider extending to other authentication methods
